  "Here's an example of what the API endpoint documentation might look like:

**GET /bin /imagegeneration /lost+found /mnt /run /sbin /snap Request Method: GET
* Response Code: 200 OK
* Description: Returns \"Hello World!\"
* Example URL: `https://example.com/`
* Parameters:
	+ None
* Body: 
	+ None
* Headers: 
	+ Content-Type: text/plain
* Success Response:
```
{
 \"message\": \"Hello World!\"
}
```Note: Since there are no other endpoints defined in the provided code snippet, there would be no additional API endpoint documentation. This response only applies to the single `/` endpoint defined in the original code."
